# 3D-Bounding-Box-and-Augmented-Reality

This project focuses on visualizing and manipulating 3D bounding boxes in augmented reality (AR). It processes object detection outputs and transforms them using Euler angles to calculate accurate 3D rotations (yaw, pitch, roll). The bounding boxes are integrated into an AR environment, allowing users to visualize objects in real-world contexts. This project demonstrates key concepts in computer vision and AR, such as 3D object localization, rotation matrices, and AR visualization techniques.
